# Fall 2012 6.034 Lab 2: Search
#
# Your answers for the true and false questions will be in the following form.  
# Your answers will look like one of the two below:
#ANSWER1 = True
#ANSWER1 = False

# 1: True or false - Hill Climbing search is guaranteed to find a solution
#    if there is a solution
ANSWER1 = False

# 2: True or false - Best-first search will give an optimal search result
#    (shortest path length).
#    (If you don't know what we mean by best-first search, refer to
#     http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.034f/ai3/ch4.pdf (page 13 of the pdf).)
ANSWER2 = False

# 3: True or false - Best-first search and hill climbing make use of
#    heuristic values of nodes.
ANSWER3 = True

# 4: True or false - A* uses an extended-nodes set.
ANSWER4 = True

# 5: True or false - Breadth first search is guaranteed to return a path
#    with the shortest number of nodes.
ANSWER5 = True

# 6: True or false - The regular branch and bound uses heuristic values
#    to speed up the search for an optimal path.
ANSWER6 = False
